## Small Writeup for Hackathon1
Basically I applied 3 different Models for this hackathon.
The first model being the linear regression model,in this model I tried to find the features which were best suited for fitting using scatter plots.I also did outlier analysis which improved the accuracy of the model...then I converted the linear regression model to polynomial regression model(degree 2) which gave further improvement in fitting.
After this much I was unable to improve the fitting using linear regression..(at that time I only knew linear and logistic regression) so I searched the web for models which could improve my fitting ... then after some research I decided to apply random forest regressor ... the score did not improve using this model.
So, then I applied support vector regression(I had no idea of this model) , so I surfed the web regarding this model, tried to grasp some of the details of this model.... took segments of it's code from net and applied this model...after making many tweeks, accuracy of this model was better than the linear regression model(I got to rank 9-10 something by this model and was pretty much satisfied.............  :)    ).
Then after some more research and towards the end of the hackathon I found that the fitting can be improved further using neural network(again I had no idea of this) so , using web I studied this and implemented its code and after making some changes my score improved!
